exploring chicken scheme modules
resulting exploration of puzzle is not entirely robust

can see visually there is a wall where cannot cross so need to go far left
through gap and then straight to coordinate 35 , 1

move right
down left left up right
and rinse and repeat until *GOLD* data is moved all the way across to coordinate 1,1
then done

using program found STEPS = 244
